Then we need to do is to run bgpvpn as a python module and then use all internal things that the class Testcase offers in Functest (https://github.com/opnfv/functest/blob/master/functest/core/testcase.py#L42-L48).",

But looks like results.get_ping_status, results.check_ssh_output updates details by invoking add_to_summary. So It\u0027s not required to explicitly update results.details as you mentioned. Jose, Can you agree to this ?",
