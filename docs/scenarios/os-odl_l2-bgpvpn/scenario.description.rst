Introduction
============
.. In this section explain the purpose of the scenario and the types of capabilities provided

Many Telecom network functions are relying on layer-3 infrastructure services, within a VNF
between components, or towards existing external networks. In many cases, these external
networks are implemented in MPLS/BGP technology in existing service provider wide-area-networks (WAN).
This proven technology provides a good mechanism for inter-operation of a NFV Infrastructure (NFVI)
and wide-area networks (WAN) and is the main capability provided by the OPNFV SDNVPN project.

.. should we explain here what a deployment scenario is?
The OPNFV SDNVPN feature is made available through additional OPNFV deployment scenarios, which are derived
from the baseline scenarios os-odl_l2-nofeature and os-odl_l3-nofeature. This document
provides an outline of the os-odl_l2-bgpvpn scenarios including guidelines and references to
required installation, software and hardware configuration documents.

Scenario components and composition
===================================
.. In this section describe the unique components that make up the scenario,
.. what each component provides and why it has been included in order
.. to communicate to the user the capabilities available in this scenario.

The SDN VPN feature enhances OPNFV's baseline OpenStack deployment with the
possibility to configure BGP based VPNs according to the OpenStack Neutron
Stadium project BGPVPN. The BGPVPN project consists of a Neutron API extension and a
service plugin which has a driver framework similar to the ML2 plugin. BGPVPN today
has a quite large number of backend drivers (Bagpipe, OpenContrail,
Nuage and OpenDaylight currently). In OPNFV, currently only the OpenDaylight driver
is supported.

The BGPVPN ODL driver maps the BGPVPN API onto the OpenDaylight VPNService, which exposes the data
center overlay like a virtual router to which Neutron Networks and Routers (and in the future also Ports)
are connected. The VPNService has access to the state of the Neutron API through the OpenDaylight
Neutron Northbound Interface module, which has been enhanced to support the BGPVPN API extension.
It uses an internal mesh of VxLAN tunnels to interconnect the vSwitches on the data
center compute nodes. For the purpose of BGP based route exchange with other BGP speakers the ODL
controller makes use of Quagga BGP as an external BGP speaker.

Scenario usage overview
=======================
.. Provide a brief overview on how to use the scenario and the features available to the
.. user.  This should be an "introduction" to the user guide document, and explicitly link to it,
.. where the specifics of the features are covered including examples and API's

  When would I use this scenario, what value does it provide?  Refer to the user guide for details
  of configuration etc...

Configuring SDNVPN features
---------------------------

Each installer has specific procedures to deploy the OPNFV platform so that the SDNVPN feature is enabled.

Fuel installer configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install the SDNVPN feature using Fuel, follow the Fuel installation guide ensuring to select the SDNVPN
feature when prompted <add link to Fuel docs once artifact locations are known>.

This will trigger installation of the OpenStack BGPVPN API extension for
Neutron, set up for using the ODL driver, in addition to vanilla Neutron.
In addition, the required karaf features will be activated when ODL is installed and the compute nodes
will be configured including the VPN Service internal transport tunnel mesh.

No post-deploy configuration is necessary. The Fuel BGPVPN plugin and the ODL plugin
should set up the cluster ready for BGPVPNs being created.

APEX installer configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install the SDNVPN feature using the APEX installer, follow the APEX installation guide and
activate the SDNVPN feature when prompted.

Limitations, Issues and Workarounds
===================================
.. Explain scenario limitations here, this should be at a design level rather than discussing
.. faults or bugs.  If the system design only provide some expected functionality then provide
.. some insight at this point.

Currently, in OPNFV only ODL is supported as a backend for BGPVPN. API calls are
mapped onto the ODL VPN Service REST API through the BGPVPN ODL driver and the
ODL Neutron Northbound module.

No DPDK-enabled vhost user ports

Integration with data center gateway will not work due to missing OVS patches for MPLSoGRE.
