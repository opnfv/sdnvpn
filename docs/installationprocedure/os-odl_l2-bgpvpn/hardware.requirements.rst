Hardware requirements
=====================

Bare metal deployment on Pharos Lab
-----------------------------------

Hardware requirements for bare-metal deployments of the OPNFV infrastucture are specified
by the Pharos project. The Pharos project provides an OPNFV hardware specification for
configuring your hardware at: http://artifacts.opnfv.org/pharos/docs/pharos-spec.html.

Virtual deployment hardware requirements
----------------------------------------

To perform a virtual deployment of an OPNFV scenario on a single host, that host has to
meet the hardware requirements outlined in the <missing spec>.

.. Additional Hardware requirements
.. --------------------------------
..
.. Your scenario may require specific capabilities that are not explicitly stated in
.. the Pharos spec.  If this is the case add your specific hardware requirements to this
.. section of the document under sub-headings.
