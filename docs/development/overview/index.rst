SDN VPN
=======

A high-level description of the scenarios is provided in this section.
For details of the scenarios and their provided capabilities refer to
the scenario description document:
http://artifacts.opnfv.org/danube/sdnpvn/scenarios/os-odl_l2-bgpvpn/index.html

The BGPVPN feature enables creation of BGP VPNs on the Neutron API according to the OpenStack
BGPVPN blueprint at https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/neutron-bgp-vpn.
In a nutshell, the blueprint defines a BGPVPN object and a number of ways
how to associate it with the existing Neutron object model, as well as a unique
definition of the related semantics. The BGPVPN framework supports a backend
driver model with currently available drivers for Bagpipe, OpenContrail, Nuage
and OpenDaylight. The OPNFV scenario makes use of the OpenDaylight driver and backend
implementation through the ODL NetVirt project.

        Ping from VM1 to VM4 should not work
        Associate SN2 to VPN1
        Ping from VM4 to VM5 should work
        Ping from VM1 to VM4 should not work (disabled until isolation fixed upstream)
        Ping from VM1 to VM5 should not work (disabled until isolation fixed upstream)
        Change VPN 1 so that iRT=eRT

    Test setup procedure:
    Set up VM1 and VM2 on Node1 and VM3 on Node2, all having ports in the same Neutron Network N1.
    VM1 and VM2 have IP addresses in a subnet SN1 with range 10.10.10/24
        VM1: 10.10.10.11, running an HTTP server which returns "I am VM1" for any HTTP request
        (or something else than an HTTP server)
        VM2: 10.10.10.12, running an HTTP server which returns "I am VM2" for any HTTP request
    VM3 has an IP address in a subnet SN2 with range 10.10.11/24
        VM3: 10.10.11.13, running an HTTP server which returns "I am VM3" for any HTTP request
    Set up VM4 on Node1 and VM5 on Node2, both having ports in Neutron Network N2
    VM4 has an address in a subnet SN1b with range 10.10.10/24
        VM4: 10.10.10.12 (the same as VM2), running an HTTP server which returns "I am VM4" for any HTTP request
    VM5 has an address in a subnet SN2b with range 10.10.11/24
        VM5: 10.10.11.13 (the same as VM3), running an HTTP server which returns "I am VM5" for any HTTP request

    Test execution:
        Create VPN 1 with iRT=eRT=RT1 and associate N1 to it

            It returns "I am VM2" and "I am VM3" respectively
        HTTP from VM1 to VM4 and VM5 should not work
            It never returns "I am VM4" or "I am VM5"
        Create VPN2 with iRT=eRT=RT2 and associate N2 to it
        HTTP from VM4 to VM5 should work
            It returns "I am VM5"
        HTTP from VM4 to VM1 and VM3 should not work
            It never returns "I am VM1" or "I am VM3"


    Test Case 3 - Data Center Gateway integration

    Verify that the OpenDaylight and gateway Quagga peer each other
    Start an instance in a second  nova compute node and connect it with a new network, (Network 3-3).
    Create a bgpvpn (include parameters route-distinguisher and route-targets) and associate it with the network created
    Define the same route-distinguisher and route-targets on the simulated quagga side
    Check that the routes from the Network 3-3 are advertised towards simulated Quagga VM

    Test Case 4 - VPN provides connectivity between subnets using router association
    Functest: variant of Test Case 1.
    Set up a Router R1 with one connected network/subnet N1/S1.

    Change VPN1 so that iRT=eRT
        Ping from VM1 to VM4 should work
        Ping from VM1 to VM5 should work

    Test Case 7 - Network associate a subnet with a router attached to a VPN and
    verify floating IP functionality (disabled, because of ODL Bug 6962)

    A test for https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6962

    Setup procedure:
    Create VM1 in a subnet with a router attached.
    Create VM2 in a different subnet with another router attached.
    Network associate them to a VPN with iRT=eRT
    Ping from VM1 to VM2 should work
    Assign a floating IP to VM1
    Pinging the floating IP should work

    Test Case 8 - Router associate a subnet with a router attached to a VPN and
    verify floating IP functionality

    Setup procedure:
    Create VM1 in a subnet with a router which is connected with the gateway
    Create VM2 in a different subnet without a router attached.
    Assoc the two networks in a VPN iRT=eRT
    One with router assoc, other with net assoc
    Try to ping from one VM to the other
    Assign a floating IP to the VM in the router assoc network
    Ping it

    Test Case 9 - Check fail mode in OVS br-int interfaces
    This testcase checks if the fail mode is always “secure”.
    To accomplish it, a check is performed on all OVS br-int interfaces, for all OpenStack nodes.
    The testcase is considered as successful if all OVS br-int interfaces have fail_mode=secure


    Test Case 10 - Check the communication between a group of VMs
    This testcase investigates if communication between a group of VMs is interrupted upon deletion
    and creation of VMs inside this group.

    Test case flow:
        Create 3  VMs:  VM_1  on compute 1, VM_2 on compute 1, VM_3 on compute 2.
        All VMs ping each other.
        VM_2  is deleted.
        Traffic is still flying between VM_ 1 and VM_3.
        A new VM, VM_ 4  is added to compute 1.
        Traffic is not interrupted and VM_4 can be reached as well.


    Testcase 11: test Opendaylight resync and group_add_mod feature mechanisms
    This is testcase to test Opendaylight resync and group_add_mod feature functionalities

    Sub-testcase 11-1:
    Create and start 2 VMs, connected to a common Network.
        New groups should appear in OVS dump
    OVS disconnects and the VMs and the networks are cleaned.
        The new groups are still in the OVS dump,
        cause OVS  is not connected anymore, so it is not notified that the groups are deleted
    OVS re-connects.
        The new groups should be deleted, as Opendaylight has to resync the groups totally and
        should remove the groups since VMS are deleted.

    Sub-testcase 11-2:
    Create and start 2 VMs, connected to a common Network.
        New groups should appear in OVS dump
    OVS disconnects.
        The new groups are still in the OVS dump, cause OVS is not connected anymore,
        so it is not notified that the groups are deleted
    OVS re-connects.
        The new groups should be still there, as the topology remains. Opendaylight Carbon's
        group_add_mod mechanism should handle the already existing group.
    OVS re-connects.
        The new groups should be still there, as the topology remains.
        Opendaylight Carbon’ group_add_mod mechanism should handle the already existing group.

    Testcase 12: Test Resync mechanism between Opendaylight and OVS
    This is the testcase to validate flows and groups are programmed correctly
    after resync which is triggered by OVS del-controller/set-controller commands
    and adding/remove iptables drop rule on OF port 6653.

    Sub-testcase 12-1:
    Create and start 2 VMs, connected to a common Network
        New flows and groups were added to OVS
    Reconnect the OVS by running del-ontroller and set-controller commands
        The flows and groups are still intact and none of the flows/groups
        are removed
    Reconnect the OVS by adding ip tables drop rule and then remove it
        The flows and groups are still intact and none of the flows/groups
        are removed

    Testcase 13: Test ECMP (Equal-cost multi-path routing) for the extra route
    This testcase validates spraying behavior in OvS when an extra route is
    configured such that it can be reached from two nova VMs in the
    same network.

   Setup procedure:
   Create and start VM1 and VM2 configured with sub interface set to same ip
   address in both VMs, connected to a common network/router.
   Update the VM1 and VM2's Neutron ports with allowed address pairs for sub
   interface ip/mac addresses.
   Create BGPVPN with two route distinguishers.
   Associate router with BGPVPN.
   Update the router with above sub-interface ip address with nexthops set to
   VMs ip addresses.
   Create VM3 and connected to the same network.
   Ping sub-interface IP address from VM3.
