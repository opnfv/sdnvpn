A high-level description of the scenarios is provided in this section.
For details of the scenarios and their provided capabilities refer to

The BGPVPN feature enables creation of BGP VPNs on the Neutron API according to the OpenStack
BGPVPN blueprint at https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/neutron-bgp-vpn.
In a nutshell, the blueprint defines a BGPVPN object and a number of ways
how to associate it with the existing Neutron object model, as well as a unique
definition of the related semantics. The BGPVPN framework supports a backend
driver model with currently available drivers for Bagpipe, OpenContrail, Nuage
and OpenDaylight. The OPNFV scenario makes use of the OpenDaylight driver and backend
implementation through the ODL NetVirt project.
