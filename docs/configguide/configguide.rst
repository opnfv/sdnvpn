Configuring SDNVPN features
---------------------------

Fuel installer configuration
<Niko: explain which settings have to / can be chosen in Fuel to get SDN VPN 
deployed.>

Feature configuration
No post-deploy configuration is necessary. The Fuel BGPVPN plugin and the ODL 
plugin should set up the cluster in a way that it is ready for BGPVPNs being 
created. This includes the set-up of internal VxLAN transport tunnels between 
compute nodes. 

No post-configuration activities are required.
