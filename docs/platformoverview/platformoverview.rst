SDNVPN platform components and features
---------------------------------------

The SDN VPN feature enhances OPNFV's baseline OpenStack deployment with the
possibility to configure BGP based VPNs according to the OpenStack Neutron
Stadium project BGPVPN. The BGPVPN project consists of an API specification,
framework implementation and a number of backend drivers (Bagpipe, OpenContrail,
Nuage and OpenDaylight currently). In OPNFV Brahmaputra only the ODL backend
is supported.
