Something like:\n\n# Test whether router assoc can coexist with floating IP\n# - Create VM1 in net1 with a subnet which is connected to a router\n#    which is connected with the gateway\n# - Create VM2 in net2 with a subnet without a router attached.\n# - Create bgpvpn with iRT\u003deRT\n# - Assoc the router of net1 with bgpvpn and assoc net 2 with the bgpvpn\n# - Try to ping from one VM to the other\n# - Assign a floating IP to the VM in the router assoc network\n# - Ping it the floating ip",
